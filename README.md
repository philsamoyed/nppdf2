Challenges remain
for NPs, despite
positive perceptions
This literature review uncovers the challenges nurse practitioners
face in performing their role in health services around the world.
By Georgia Mclnroe
S
ince the nurse practitioner (NP) role was
introduced into health services 40 years
ago, NPs have become some of the most
valued members of the health-care team^
providing quality, cost-effective and holistic
health care in a way that satisfies patients.
The role was first used in the United States in
the 1960s, and NPs now practise in more than
50 countries, including New Zealand.
The NP is described as a registered nurse
with specialist experience and comprehension, intricate decision-making abilities,
and the expertise and clinical capabilities to
undertake specialist practice in a particular
clinical area.3 NPs apply expert postgraduate education and a comprehensive nursing
philosophy to meet the health-care needs of
clients and communities.5 They improve access to holistic clinical and community-based
health care, address social determinants of
health, and assess health educational needs of
individuals, families and communities, and design programmes that meet these needs. NPs
enhance community engagement and health
collaboration^
Despite these positive perceptions, challenges remain for NPs.36 Literature indicates
these challenges include lack of role clarity,
lack of support from other health professions, and restrictive and irrelevant policy,
legislation and funding. This literature review
explores the challenges faced by NPs.
Articles were searched through the computerised databases CINAHL, Cochrane Library,
ProQuest Central and MEDLINE (PubMed),
using keywords including "nurse practitioner",
"professional", "clinical practice", "barriers",
"challenges" and "issues". To ensure the credGeorgia Mclnroe
ib ility and relevance of the articles found, the
search was limited to articles that were written in English, peer reviewed and published
since 2003.
A total of 57 relevant articles were retrieved, of which 12 were used for this review.
Ten were research articles - most of them
qualitative research. Also included were two
literature reviews. Articles were chosen that
focused on the experience of NPs, rather
than that of clients, as this literature review
focuses on challenges and barriers perceived
by NPs.
The 12 articles showed NPs were experiencing three key problems: role ambiguity, lack of
team support, and restrictive legislation and
regulatory frameworks.
► Role clarity
Two groups of researchers agreed that NPs integrated nursing and medical knowledge, and
theory and research; and that they developed
and advanced nursing knowledge and the profession as a whole^ However, the literature
indicated that often both other health professionals and the public did not understand
what an NP was, nor what their role was.
This lack of role clarity often left NPs in the
position of having to advocate for themselves
about their position, which could leave them
feeling upset and frustrated.
NPs are at a pivotal phase in the development of their role in health services. They
must delineate their role, establish their
philosophy of health-care delivery and demonstrate their capabilities^ It is vital that health
service organisations, other health professionals, policy makers and the public clearly
understand the NP role and the ability of
these expert nurses to improve service delivery
and client outcomes.
One study used interpretive epistemology
and qualitative methodology to interview 25
NPs, with different amounts of practice experience in various clinical settings. This provided
a wide range of perceptions on the working
of the NP role.? The study found that outlining their role and scope of practice had been
a major challenge for NPs, as they worked
to establish a sustainable role and positive
working relationships with colleagues. Other
literature also saw role clarity as fundamental
to achieving recognition from clients, colleagues, health .ofija'ni^tion leaders and the
public. This recognition, in turn, conveyed an
approval of the NP role, which helped lead to
improved access to health care.45
One mixed-method study explored how clinicians, managers and policy makers perceived
NP roles and barriers to the NP role. The
authors found the three groups questioned
(nurse practitioners, clinical managers and
policy makers) all had a positive perception
of NP roles, but also all believed there was
a general lack of knowledge about the role.
This was consistent with the findings of other
studies,34 which agreed the lack of role clarity
caused confusion about the contribution NPs
made to the health-care team. This, in turn,
affected the potential contribution NPs could
make to service delivery, and obstructed relationships with colleagues.
In contrast, findings from a subjective
study exploring barriers to the NP role,2 found
NP respondents generally felt their role was
perceived positively. This study was limited to
one rural province in Canada. Acceptance of
the role was believed to have been enhanced
by education in the region about the benefits
of integrating the NP role into health services.
Another study,6 which looked at NPs in
emergency departments (EDs), found these
NPs did not perceive a lack of support for,
or a lack of understanding of, their roles
20 Kai Tiaki Nursing New Zealand * vol 22 no 2 * March 2016
literature review
among their ED colleagues. This may have
been because in emergency areas, NPs have
a greater understanding of their own roles as
there are more NPs in EDs than in other fields
of practice.
The level of understanding of NP roles
will remain low, and the development and
implementation of the role will continue to be
affected, unless these roles have more clarity
and better definition. Ensuring role clarity
for an NP within a particular clinical area,
would increase support and authority for the
NP, with direct positive effects on practice^
To improve understanding of the role, it
needs to be promoted,
both in health services
and among the general
public. This would encourage confidence in
NPs, as well as making
this important specialist-nursing role more
secure.2
► Lack of team support
A number of studies said support from the
other health professions was critical to establishing NP roles in the health-care team.j 2 34
One qualitative study said medicaL support
was a pertinent factor in NP job satisfaction^
Another said that, although there remained a
degree of medical opposition to the NP role,
physicians' support was crucial to its effective
establishment, particularly in the early stages
of implementation. The introduction of NPs
changed the allocation of tasks and modified
interactions between the health professions^
Some authors emphasised the importance of
effective relationship adjustments and the
potential for disruption to the health-care
team.
Researchers have a tendency to focus studies on NPs' relationships with clients, but
one of the reviewed studies used interpretive
and qualitative methodology to focus on NP
relationships with members of the health
professional team and revealed the problems
that develop. The authors used open-ended
interviews to collect information on issues
as viewed by NPs and health-care managers in a variety of health-care settings. This
interviewing technique allowed respondents
to fully explore their views on the topic.g
Interviews were recorded, transcribed and
analysed for key issues and responses. Interprofessional support was an important issue
for respondents, who said it was pertinent to
the establishment, sustainability and continuing growth of the NP role.
These conclusions were supported by
another study. This said that, although the
development of constructive and effective relationships between physicians and NPs might
be challenging at times, the successful integration of the role in the workplace resulted
in good coordination and positive health-care
experiences for clients.
Another study found many NPs believed
team collaboration was a cornerstone of their
practice, even though relationships with other
professionals could be challenging. Although
this study was limited to nine NPs in a rural
Canadian province, the authors used techniques to improve the
objectivity of their
research, such as sustained engagement,
peer debriefing and
member checking.
In another crosssectional descriptive
study, data was collected using a satisfaction
scale and a single-item questionnaire.5 The
auttior^explored job satisfaction for 254 NPs
vyh,p attended the 2008 American Academy
of |UPs national conference. This group was
pripiafily female and Caucasian, with a mean
age: of 47.2 years, an average of 20 years' RN
experience and eight years' NP experience.
The sample of NPs who participated in this
study'might not accurately represent the NP
population, as it could be concluded that an
educated, highly motivated and professional
group of NPs attend NP conferences. Despite
this, the authors found that respondents were
minimally satisfied with the sense of professional growth, inter-practice partnership
and collegiality they
experienced. Studies
suggested that once
other staff became
familiar with the
role, they were more
comfortable working
with, and were more
welcoming to, NP colleagues.8
► Restrictive and irrelevant policy
Research findings consistently indicated the
positive effect of the NP role on health-care
provision and outcomes and on client satisfaction. Despite this, full implementation of the
role remained challenging and incomplete.
There was evidence that restrictive and irrelevant policy might be an obstacle to the
continuation and further development of the
r o ^e ,2,5,8
Disparities between policy and the reality
of the NP role were an issue in Australia. One
study suggested that without the government
requiring health organisations to putin place
structures to support NPs, the development
and implementation of the role was likely to
remain challenging^ Another study supported
this and said cooperative decision-making
was required to successfully support NPs. NPs
also needed to get more involved in strategic
political action to improve health services.
The Australian government had assumed regional health authorities were responsible for
service delivery and implementatiing NP roles;
there were many discrepancies to resolve
between health services in their arrangements
and policies relating to NPs.
In British Columbia, Canada, the provincial
government also passed on the responsibility for implementing the NP role to health
authorities, where little was done to manage
or develop the role.3
Health authorities presumed that health
systems were equipped for NP roles to be
applied nationally; yet, as many qualitative studies showed, clinical services lacked
the technical and procedural infrastructure,
staff support and the strategic management
necessary to resolve the complexities of role
development^ 2 3 5 7
A number of respondents in an Australian
study said government financial policy had severely constrained the efficiency and proficiency of NPs practising in mainstream and rural
and remote services^ However, a relatively low
response rate (38 per cent) might indicate a
degree of sampling bias. Despite this lim itation, all Australian states and territories were
represented among the respondents, providing a broad national perspective and strength
to the study. A
case study of NP
roles in Victoria,
Australia, agreed
with these findings
and said the financial policy meant
health consumers
receiving care from an NP were commonly not
entitled to subsidies. 10 This policy applied
right across Australia and affected access to
health-care services.
A case study on the introduction of NPs
into primary care services found problems
caused by the legislation governing NPs were
due to the lack of involvement of NPs in the
development of policy in the early stages of
implementation^ NPs communicated concerns
about being compared to physicians and
dictated to according to restrictions designed
for physicians.
Various authors also noted that policy

literature review
development processes allowing nurses to
practise in extended roles were overly oppressive and created barriers for nurses in these
roles.j 5 7 This view was supported by another study, which suggested that legislative
frameworks had failed to keep up with practice
changes.2
A study that looked at the "power and
politics of collaboration" in the development
of the NP role said policy developers acknowledged that irrelevant legislative frameworks
were an issue.,. NPs said they had not had
enough opportunity to take part in developing
policy. The results of this study provide insight
into how NPs can be involved in policy development to ensure future changes are relevant
to continuously evolving practice of NPs.
Conclusion
A large amount of literature describes the
NP role as an effective means of improving health-care delivery and increasing the
proficiency of the health-care team. However,
this literature review has found evidence of
the challenges impeding the sustainability and
stability of the role. The challenges identified
are consistent throughout many studies - they
included lack of role clarity, lack of interprofessional health support and restrictive and
irrelevant policy or funding.
As the clarity of the role develops, so will
the acknowledgment of, and rapport with, the
other health professions and clients. Removing these uncertainties and establishing a
supportive environment in which NPs practise
will enable effective practice and better client outcomes. This literature review has also
shown the need for clinical areas to clarify
the importance of the NP role and its scope of
practice.
Also, the support of the health-care team
is fundamental to the establishment and
maintenance of effective NP roles, and is
also important for NP job satisfaction. The
literature suggests a degree of opposition to
the role from other health professions remains.
The introduction of the NP role changes the
allocation of tasks and working relationships
in the health-care team.
Restrictive and irrelevant policy is a real
challenge for NPs, as it leads to inappropriate
practice restrictions and funding problems.
The literature indicates this may be secondary to the fact that legislative frameworks fail
to keep up with practice changes. Also, many
governments gave responsibility for implementing the role to health authorities where
there was minimal management or direction
for developing the role.
There is hope that clinical managers, policy
22
It is vital that health services, health professionals, policy makers
and the public understand the NP role and the ability of these
expert nurses to improve service delivery and client outcomes.
developers and health professionals will come
up with workable strategies to ensure the NP
role is integrated into health-care teams in
a planned and sustainable way. NPs need to
be more involved in policy development to
advocate for their role and decrease perceived
challenges.
Benefits and challenges
This literature review confirms the benefits
of the NP role, and outlines the factors that
influence and challenge NPs. Hopefully this
review will raise awareness of the barriers NPs
face in their daily practice and the importance
of reducing these barriers.
It also highlights how important it is for
health professionals to understand the role
of their colleagues, to promote a supportive
and therapeutic work environment and foster
excellence in client care.
The NP role has been shown to
be exceedingly beneficial to the
health of the community, both
in New Zealand and overseas.
Acknowledging and addressing the
barriers and challenges outlined
in this literature review is vital
to the future development and
implementation of the role. This
is a process that will require
education and policy amendment.
Being aware of these factors
should encourage nurse managers
and educators to support and educate staff about the NP role, the
difference they make, the challenges they face and the support
they require.
This review has identified
restrictive and irrelevant policies
related to the NP role in clinical
practice. Although many nurses
have little involvement in policy
development, this review shows
the importance of understanding
the implications that restrictive
and irrelevant policies can have on clinical
practice and client outcomes. NPs need the
support and active involvement of nursing colleagues and allied health professionals to be
involved in policy development. •
